# HTML_Course-Code_With_Harry
This repository contains all the code files containing codes which I have written while implementing whatever I was taught in each lecture.
I have gone through HTML lectures (12 lectures in total) being provided by CodeWithHarry under his Web Development Course on youtube various times in past, but here I gone through it once again to revise the concepts as it was been long since I had worked on any development stuff.
